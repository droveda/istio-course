# Telemetry

* Will be using:
  * Kiali
  * Jaeger
  * Grafana
  * Files in the folder "1-Telemetry"
  * Will need to restart the kubernetes service in order to clean everything
  * Install istio and Apply the yaml files in order
  * OBS, do not forget to Execute: `kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled`

## Kiali Deeper Dive
Telemetry Requirements:  
* You need a (Envoy Sidecar) Proxy sidecar running in every pod you want to monitor
* The control plane needs to be running (ie istiod and kiali, jaeger, grafana)
* kiali url: `http://localhost:31000`

### Virtual Services and Destination Rules
* kubectl get virtual services
* kubectl get vs
* kubectl get destinationrules
* kubectl get dr
* You can create these using the Kiali UI, right click on a service and using the "Actions" option

### Distributed Tracing
* Opentelemetry - https://opentelemetry.io/
* Distributed tracing lets you observe requests as they propagate through complex, distributed systems. Distributed tracing improves the visibility of your application or systemâ€™s health and lets you debug behavior that is difficult to reproduce locally. It is essential for distributed systems, which commonly have nondeterministic problems or are too complicated to reproduce locally.
* Client library for a particular language
* https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/observability-primer/
* With a service mesh all of this down at the proxy level
  * with istio we don't have to use these client libraries at all
* Traces:
  * The path of a request through your application.
  * Traces give us the big picture of what happens when a request is made to an application. 
* Span:
  * A span represents a unit of work or operation. Spans are the building blocks of Traces

#### Metrics with Grafana
* Access the following URL: http://localhost:31002/
* It takes some time to load
* Navigate to home and select one of the already pre-built dashboards
* Some useful dashboards:
  * Istio Sevice Dashboard
  * Istio Workload Dashboard

# Traffic Management

## Canary Releases
* will be using folder "2-Traffic" files

Deploy a new version of a software component (for us, new image)  
But only make that new image "live" for a percentage of the time  
Most of the time, the old (definitely working) version is the one beign used  

### What is a VirtualService?
A VirtualService enables us to configure custom routing rules to the service mesh  

Where does a VirtualService fit in?  
Virtual Services Configure the Proxies!  

* Points to Note:
  * Despite the name, VirtualService and Service are not really related
  * VirtualServices do not replace Services - they do different jobs
  * You only need a VirtualService if you need one!

### What is Destination Rule?
